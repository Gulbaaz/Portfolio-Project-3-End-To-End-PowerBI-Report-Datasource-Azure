# Portfolio Project 3 – End-To-End Power BI Report (Datasource: Azure)

**Description:**  
This project is part of my professional portfolio, aimed at showcasing my expertise in working with different data sources and performing end-to-end data analysis. In this project, I demonstrate how to connect, clean, and analyze a real-world Men’s T-shirt dataset using **Azure SQL** and **Power BI**. The dataset was structured, cleaned, and analyzed to extract insights related to brand performance, pricing trends, discounts, and profitability, reflecting hands-on experience with cloud-based data management and business intelligence tools.
